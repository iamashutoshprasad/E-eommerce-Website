        Bryan Guy Adams OC OBC FRPS (born November 5, 1959) is a Canadian
        musician, singer, songwriter, record producer, and photographer. He has
        been described as one of the best-selling music artists of all time, and
        is estimated to have sold between 75 million[2] and more than 100
        million records and singles worldwide.[3][4][5] Adams has had 25 top-15
        singles in Canada and a dozen or more in each of the US, UK, and
        Australia.[5] At age 15, Adams replaced Nick Gilder as lead singer of
        glam rock band Sweeney Todd and at age 20 his eponymous debut album was
        released. He rose to fame in North America with the 1983 top ten album
        Cuts Like a Knife, featuring its title track and the ballad "Straight
        From the Heart", his first US top ten hit. His 1984 Canadian and US
        number one album, Reckless (which became the first album by a Canadian
        to be certified diamond in Canada), made him a global star with six
        charting singles including "Run to You" and "Summer of '69", both top
        ten hits in the US and Canada, and the power ballad "Heaven", a US
        number one hit.[6] His 1987 album Into the Fire, with its US and
        Canadian top ten song, "Heat of the Night", rose to number two in Canada
        and the top ten in the US and several other countries. In 1989, he ended
        the decade by co writing with fellow Canadian songwriter Jim Vallance
        and American songwriter Diane Warren "When the Night Comes", played at
        the end credits of that year's Tom Selleck starred crime drama, An
        Innocent Man.
