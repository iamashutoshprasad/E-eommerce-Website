        Marshall Bruce Mathers III (born October 17, 1972), known professionally
        as Eminem (/ˌɛmɪˈnɛm/; often stylized as EMINƎM), is an American rapper
        and actor. He is credited with popularizing hip hop in Middle America
        and is frequently mentioned among the greatest rappers of all time.[3]
        Eminem's global success and acclaimed works are widely regarded as
        having broken racial barriers for the acceptance of white rappers in
        popular music. While much of his transgressive work during the late
        1990s and early 2000s made him a controversial figure, he came to be a
        representation of popular angst of the American underclass and has been
        cited as an influence by and upon many artists working in various
        genres. After the release of his debut album Infinite (1996) and the
        extended play Slim Shady EP (1997), Eminem signed with Dr. Dre's
        Aftermath Entertainment and subsequently achieved mainstream popularity
        in 1999 with The Slim Shady LP. His next two releases, The Marshall
        Mathers LP (2000) and The Eminem Show (2002), were worldwide successes
        and were both nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year.
        After the release of his next album, Encore (2004), Eminem went on
        hiatus in 2005, largely due to a prescription drug addiction.[4] He
        returned to the music industry four years later with the release of
        Relapse (2009) and Recovery, which was released the following year.
        Recovery was the bestselling album worldwide of 2010, making it Eminem's
        second album, after The Eminem Show in 2002, to be the best-selling
        album of the year worldwide. In the following years, he released the US
        number one albums The Marshall Mathers LP 2 (2013), Revival (2017),
        Kamikaze (2018), and Music to Be Murdered By (2020).
